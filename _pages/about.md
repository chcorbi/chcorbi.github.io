I am a postdoctoral researcher in deep learning and computer vision at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/) in the [Visual Intelligence for Transportation (VITA)](https://vita.epfl.ch/) lab, advised by [Prof. Alexandre Alahi](https://people.epfl.ch/alexandre.alahi). My current research focuses on leveraging large multimodal models for safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving.

Before joining EPFL, I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science in March 2022, conducted jointly at the [Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers](http://cedric.cnam.fr/lab/teams/vertigo-en/) and [valeo.ai](https://valeoai.github.io). I was fortunate to benefit from the supervision of [Prof. Nicolas Thome](https://thome.isir.upmc.fr/) and [Dr. Patrick Pérez](https://ptrckprz.github.io/). My doctoral research centered on [robust deep learning for autonomous driving](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j8oMT7Nl4KldzowIBN_7IGEVoTSRYQLg/view?usp=share_link), which included developing methods for uncertainty estimation and improving model resilience to distributional shifts in computer vision tasks. Prior to my Ph.D., I worked as a Computer Vision Engineer at [Preligens](https://www.earthcube.eu/) (now Safran.AI), and as a Research Intern at [Heuritech](https://www.heuritech.com/). I graduated from [Master 2 Data Sciences](https://www.ip-paris.fr/education/masters/mention-mathematiques-appliquees-statistiques/master-year-2-data-science) at École Polytechnique in 2017 and I obtained a Master's degree in computer science from [Ecole Centrale de Lille](https://ecole.centralelille.fr) in 2016.
